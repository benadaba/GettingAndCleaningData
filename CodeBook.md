**CodeBook - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**

A Human Activity Recognition experiments were carried out with a group
of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS,
WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

This CodeBook represents subset of the original data recorded and
transformations that have been done to the original data.

**Subject** is chosen as a unique identifier so as to be able to get all
measurements and summaries of measurements for each participant when a
subject value is specified

A prefix ’t’ to the Variable name denotes **time domain signals**
whereas an ‘f’ indicates **frequency domain signals**

Unique Identifier: **subject**
